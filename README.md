This was inspired by the original **Bomb Timer** by [Tokyo](https://github.com/livinamuk/BombTimer). I recreated it from scratch using **Python** and **Pygame**, and had a lot of fun learning in the process!

## Usage

You can modify the timer settings in the `bomb_timer.py` file:

```python
set_minutes = 2
set_seconds = 60
