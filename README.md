# **BOMB TIMER**

![Screenshot](assets/images/Screenshot.png)


This was inspired by the original **Bomb Timer** by [Tokyo](https://github.com/livinamuk/BombTimer). I had
a lot of fun making it and learned a lot in the process.

**Usage**

You can modify the timer settings in the `bomb_timer.py` file:

```python
set_minutes = 2
set_seconds = 60
