This project was inspired by the original **Bomb Timer** by [Tokyo](https://github.com/livinamuk/BombTimer).  
I recreated it from scratch using **Python** and **Pygame**, and had a lot of fun learning in the process!

## ⚙️ Usage / Customization

You can modify the timer settings in the `bomb_timer.py` file:

```python
minutes = 0
seconds = 60
